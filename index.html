              <h2>About Stuff Happens Hauling LLC</h2>  
              <p>
                Stuff Happens Hauling LLC began as a simple idea between two college friends 
                who wanted to build something of their own—something real, hands-on, 
                and rooted outside the classroom.
              </p>
              <p>
                We pooled our time, our savings, and a pickup truck with the goal of 
                turning effort into something meaningful. Not for titles or recognition, 
                but to solve a problem people deal with every day: getting rid of things 
                that no longer serve them.
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe there’s value in showing up, doing the work yourself, 
                and standing behind it. When you reach out to us, you’re not dealing with a 
                call center or a middleman—you’re talking directly to the people 
                who load the truck and haul the job away.
              </p>
              <p class="about-us__conclusion">
                This business is built on responsibility, effort, and follow-through. No shortcuts. NO EXCUSES. Just getting the job done.
              </p>
