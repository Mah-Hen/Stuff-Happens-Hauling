        <h3>About Stuff Happens Hauling LLC</h3>
        <p>
          Stuff Happens Hauling LLC began as a simple idea between two college friends 
          who wanted to build something of their own—something real, hands-on, 
          and rooted outside the classroom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We pooled our time, our savings, and a pickup truck with the goal of 
          turning effort into something meaningful. Not for titles or recognition, 
          but to solve a problem people deal with every day: getting rid of things 
          that no longer serve them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe there’s value in showing up, doing the work yourself, 
          and standing behind it. When you reach out to us, you’re not dealing with a 
          call center or a middleman—you’re talking directly to the people 
          who load the truck and haul the job away.
        </p>
        <p class="about-us-conclusion">
          This business is built on responsibility, effort, and follow-through. No shortcuts. No excuses. Just getting the job done.
